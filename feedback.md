Project

Name / short description

What worked well Database was easy to setup (ive already done it beofre) and like the server setup was also easy (Simple localhost)

What broke / where he got stuck DELETE function was a pain in the ASS to setupl, and when a table was deleted, there was a synchronization error (Pain)

Workarounds or hints you had to give Well claude was used like... alot haha, i (yes im admitting) copied one part of the update codce cus I was pissed off. (Synchronization one)

Skills/concepts he actually used (measurable) I learnt about making CRUD operations with sqlite and typescript together, better overview on bun, How to use diffetrent request types to squeeze different types of outputs

Gaps exposed (missing knowledge, context collapse) DDD, Repository files, 

Emotional signal (frustration / flow / boredom) This project to be honest was sort of boring 😭 like idk why but i twas just boring cus like yeah cus it was sorta difficult (db operations and especially the DELETE Functionn not working etc)

Changes needed for beta (scope / clarity / scaffolding) Repositories file, DDD architecture, Error types were added after i finished  the project (Tbh they were requested before but cus of my retardedness I forgot to add them)

🔄 General Notes (per week, not per project)

Patterns in his struggles Where AI was misused or helpful Pace too slow / too fast? Did he “ship” something that felt real?
